# Ticketing System Micorservices

## Overview
This application is a comprehensive example of a multi-service architecture designed to address the challenges of building and scaling microservices. It covers a wide range of topics from frontend development using React to backend services, database design, and deployment strategies. The focus is on practical, real-world scenarios, providing solutions to common issues encountered in microservices development.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Next JS

- **Backend:**
  - Node
  - Express

- **Data Storage:**
  - MongoDB
  - Redis

- **Containerization and Orchestration:**
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes

- **Other:**
  - TypeScript

## Key Features
1. **Event-Based Architecture:**
   - Address challenges with data replication and unordered event streams.

2. **Server-Side Rendering with React:**
   - Build a full-stack application, focusing on frontend development using React and Next JS.

3. **Scalable Code:**
   - Implement production-ready code, emphasizing scalability in a microservices environment.

4. **Custom Event Bus:**
   - Develop a custom implementation of an event bus to handle asynchronous events between services.

5. **Deployment Strategies:**
   - Use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy the multi-service application on any cloud provider.

6. **Code Reusability:**
   - Organize and enhance the reusability of code in large projects.

## Application Structure
The application consists of multiple services, each serving a specific purpose. The interaction between services is facilitated by event-driven communication, and the overall structure promotes scalability and maintainability.

### Services
1. **Frontend Service:**
   - Utilizes React and Next JS for server-side rendering.
   - Presents content to users.

2. **Backend Services:**
   - Implemented using Node and Express.
   - Each service may have its data stored in either MongoDB or Redis.

3. **Data Communication:**
   - Services communicate asynchronously through a custom event bus.

4. **Containerization:**
   - The entire application is containerized using Docker.

5. **Orchestration:**
   - Deployment and scaling are managed through Kubernetes.
